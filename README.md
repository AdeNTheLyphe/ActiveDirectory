## Introduction

In this project, I build an Active Directory in Oracle VirtualBox using Microsoft Server 2019, and Microsoft Windows 10.  To keep it simple, I created the Domain Computer running Server 2019, and one (1) Client computer running Windows 10.
My goal was to create a mini "corporate" network that consisted of roughly 1000 different usernames.  I created the usernames using PowerShell.
